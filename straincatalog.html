                                This is such a popular strain and to have an original cut is pretty 
                                amazing as this strain has been in production by DJ Short since the 70s. 
                                Blueberry really is a farm favorite indica, sweet like the fruit, citrus 
                                and a bit spicy on the inhale and exhale. It’s a treat and the aromas are
                                 strong and earthy, present on both the inhale and exhale coating your palate 
                                 with its richness. The plants themselves vary in hues of red, purples and 
                                 lavender blues. The high is euphoric, long-lasting and it’s resistant
                                  to tolerance build up.

                                The heavy citrus smells of this strain come from its full terpene profile

                                 strain make it a go too for making the fly while doing routine tasks. Users

                                grape, berry and earthy tones of its parents. This strain is frosty due to the
                                 pheno type selection process. The trichome heads really give the flower and sugar 
                                 leafs a glossy, glittery, wet look. It really make the dark green bud under
